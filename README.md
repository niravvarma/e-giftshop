Project exported from Google code to GIT.

E-GiftShop is project developed on Oracle WebCenter Sites 11g (11.1.1.6.0) JSK. This project was developed for demo purpose.

It contains following implementations:

1. Simple development of webpages using Oracle WebCenter Sites (OracleWCS) tag libraries
2. Internationalization (Dimension and Dimension-Set)
3. Very low level of Cart functionality: Users can buy products, add/remove from cart and complete the transaction.
4. Using Satellite forms: Login/Logout and Register user to simple egsMember table
5. Some UI development like validation of input forms, credit card validation, twitter bootstrap, etc.
6. Synchronizing workspace to OracleWCS instance and vice-versa using ANT script (Not fully working, need to re-check)
